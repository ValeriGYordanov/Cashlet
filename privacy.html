<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 30.08.2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application Cashlet (com.vlr.cashlet), published by Valeri Yordanov under the developer name VLR in Google Play.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Cashlet mobile application (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles your personal information. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Cashlet does <strong>not collect or store any financial data on its own servers</strong>. All data is stored locally on your device or, if you choose, synchronized with Supabase (our secure cloud provider).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We use Supabase authentication to identify you. Your account ID is used to manage your storage membership.</li>
  <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> If you use Cashlet in local mode only, all data stays on your device and never leaves it.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud Data:</strong> If you create or join a storage in Supabase, your transactions, budgets, and categories are stored securely in Supabase and shared with other members of the same storage.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> If you use the free version, Cashlet may show ads through Google AdMob, which may collect anonymized ad interaction data as governed by Google’s privacy policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To enable you to manage and sync your budgets, transactions, and categories locally or in the cloud (Supabase).</li>
  <li>To keep you signed in via your Supabase account.</li>
  <li>To show ads (free version only).</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not share or sell</strong> your data with third parties.
  Data stored in Supabase is accessible only to members of your storage and protected by row-level security (RLS) policies.</p>

<h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may leave a storage at any time. If you are the last member, the storage and all related data (transactions, budgets, categories) will be <strong>permanently deleted</strong> from Supabase.</li>
  <li>This deletion is automatic and irreversible. We recommend exporting or backing up data before leaving or deleting a storage.</li>
  <li>If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be removed from your device. Cloud data in Supabase remains until you or the last member deletes or leaves the storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Protection and Security</h2>
<p>All interactions with Supabase are encrypted using HTTPS. Access is restricted by authentication and authorization rules. Locally stored data remains entirely on your device.</p>

<h2>6. Data Ownership and Access</h2>
<p>You always own your data. Whether stored locally or in Supabase, you control access through your account and storage membership.</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Cashlet is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>This policy may be updated from time to time. All updates will be posted here. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the revised policy.</p>

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:valeri.g.yordanov@gmail.com">valeri.g.yordanov@gmail.com</a>.</p>
