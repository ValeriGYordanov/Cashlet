<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 30.06.2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Cashlet mobile application (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles your personal information. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Cashlet does <strong>not collect or store any financial data</strong> on its own servers. All data is saved directly in a Google Sheet that you own and control.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> We use your Google account to authenticate you and allow the app to access your personal Google Sheets. This access is consent-based and revocable at any time via your Google account settings.</li>
  <li><strong>OAuth Access Tokens:</strong> These are stored temporarily in device memory and used only to communicate with the Google Sheets API on your behalf. Tokens are never sent to our servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We do not use any analytics or tracking SDKs.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> If you use the free version, Cashlet may show ads through Google AdMob, which may collect anonymized ad interaction data as governed by Google's privacy policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To enable you to view, edit, and manage budget data in your Google Sheet</li>
  <li>To keep you signed in via your Google account</li>
  <li>To show ads (free version only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Ownership and Access</h2>
<p>All budget data remains entirely within your personal Google account. You can open, back up, delete, or share your Sheets at any time. Cashlet never uploads your data to external servers.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We do not retain any personal or financial data. When you uninstall the app, all app-side access to your data ends. The spreadsheet itself remains in your Google Drive under your control.</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Cashlet is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>This policy may be updated from time to time. All updates will be posted here. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the revised policy.</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:valeri.g.yordanov@gmail.com">valeri.g.yordanov@gmail.com</a>.</p>
