<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 30.08.2025</p>

<p>By downloading or using the Cashlet app (“we”, “us”, or “the app”), you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the app.</p>

<h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cashlet is provided for personal budgeting and expense tracking.</li>
  <li>You must have a valid account to access cloud features powered by Supabase.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for managing your own financial data and for deciding whether to use local storage only or synchronize with Supabase.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. User Data and Privacy</h2>
<p>Your budget data may be stored locally on your device and, if you choose, synchronized with Supabase cloud storage. Access to data is restricted to members of your storage. For full details, refer to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Ads and Purchases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The free version of the app may display ads through Google AdMob.</li>
  <li>You may purchase a Pro upgrade to remove ads. Purchases are processed via Google Play and are non-refundable unless required by local law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Storage Deletion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may choose to leave a storage at any time. If you are the last member, the storage and all its associated data (transactions, categories, budgets) will be permanently deleted from Supabase.</li>
  <li>This deletion is irreversible. We recommend backing up any data you wish to keep before deleting a storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All trademarks, logos, and source code (except open-source components) remain the intellectual property of the app developer.</p>

<h2>6. Termination</h2>
<p>You may stop using the app at any time. We reserve the right to suspend, remove, or restrict access to the app or its features without notice.</p>

<h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The app is provided “as is” without warranties or guarantees of any kind.</li>
  <li>We are not responsible for any loss, damage, or errors resulting from use of the app or from reliance on your locally or cloud-stored financial data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these terms from time to time. Updates will be posted here, and continued use of the app after changes implies acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
<p>For questions or support, contact us at <a href="mailto:valeri.g.yordanov@gmail.com">valeri.g.yordanov@gmail.com</a>.</p>
